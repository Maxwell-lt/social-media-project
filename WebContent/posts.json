		"text": "This mountain was fun to climb on, even if the terrain wasn't perfect. Honestly, the mountain probably isn't as pretty as we thought it would be. As far as I know, we didn't climb anything on the last day or night because the whole mountain was covered in snow. One of the first hikes I did was on a snow covered hill to the top. It was pretty cool to see the horizon, the snow being fine and flowing just like it does in real life. If you're in the mood for mountains and snow, this is the right place.",

		"text": "The water was warm at the beach today, iced over with a layer of blankets. The hibiscus flowers were blooming, along with a good amount of grass and leaves. I stopped in the very water for a while to look at the ocean. I was very curious to see the giant waves of water, along with some beautiful emerald green rocks I didn't realize I'd seen before. As I took a few photos I discovered it was not water but icebergs! Water weighs something on land, so it does seem like this lake was hollow. Not the sort of thing you can walk around and see so no point in that, but of course it does illustrate the point I'm making.",

The Bark Plant Guide, which is freely available on the Anomalous Woodlands website, will help you identify the types and proper growing conditions for your trees. In addition, the Nature Map contains a comprehensive index for those who prefer to read about and compare specimens.",
